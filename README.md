### What is this?

Voucher Skin is the Wi-Fi Connect custom voucher on a browser extension for Omada Controller. This extension simply injects a CSS style when the page load. This is one of the best solution for me to easily print the vouchers in just a few click, compared to [Voucher Design Generator](https://github.com/MinecraftJohn/voucher-generator) that has a difficult steps just to generate fast.

> Note: You might still need [Voucher Design Generator](https://minecraftjohn.github.io/voucher-generator/) when you want to print some using your smartphone.
