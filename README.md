### What is this?

Wi-Fi Connect Print is the [Wi-Fi Connect](https://github.com/MinecraftJohn/wifi-connect) custom voucher on a browser extension for Omada Controller. This extension simply injects a CSS style when the page load. This is one of the best solution for me to easily print a customized vouchers in just a few click, compared to [Voucher Design Generator](https://github.com/MinecraftJohn/voucher-generator) that has a difficult steps just to generate fast.
